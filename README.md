# TZStudies
Why I Built This Project
I built TZStudies to address a real need in the Tanzanian education sector making past national exam resources easily accessible while streamlining the tutor recruitment process. The project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack application using modern technologies, from building a dynamic Flask backend and integrating third-party APIs (OpenAI and Gmail SMTP) to deploying a cloud-based solution with Heroku and managing data with PostgreSQL. I believe that this project shows my agile development practices, attention to user experience, and the practical application of cloud engineering, skills that are directly relevant to roles in software and full stack development.
